I was wondering have you ever been, have you ever been anything other than, other than true, have you?
Never been good but I've never been better
I was wondering have you ever been anything anything other than you, is that true?
We're not gonna be here forever
I don't want to stay here on my own
I don't want to let that body go

Be my queen, I'll be your king
We'll be rulers I'll give you everything
I'll be your king, you'll be my queen
Unbelievers get down on your knees
We can rule the world
So be my girl
I was wondering is there anything, have you ever done anything and never told anyone else but yourself?
Better slow down and hold it together
I was wondering have you ever done anything you never got it off of your chest?
Confess, or keep it in sideâ€¦
